# Key West

## Quick Tips
- Bring lots of cash. Many places don't accept credit cards.
- Book Dry Tortugas ferry ride a couple months in advance if you're going when KW is busy. They fill up quick.
- Don't book a car unless you want to get off island. You can walk everywhere with ease. If you insist on not walking, get a bike or golf cart (they call them e-cars...)
- If you like doing breakfast, getting up earlier is better. Crowds tend to come for brunch more than breakfast.
- Live music is rough

## Activities
### In Town
- [KW Aquarium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Key+West+Aquarium/@24.55907,-81.8095207,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6ec612ccdb5:0xa4ec5a8ba6f5dab7!8m2!3d24.55907!4d-81.807332) is a great air conditioned jaunt if you like aquariums. Ticket gets you 2 days of access, so if the next day you're sweating your balls off, you can go in and look at the turtles and sharks without paying again. It's small, and there are rotating talks from the staff members every 15-20 minutes.
- [Butterfly Conservatory](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Key+West+Butterfly+and+Nature+Conservatory/@24.5475638,-81.7990136,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6dcf654cb87:0x79f08121578a07fc!8m2!3d24.5475638!4d-81.7968249) is a cute way to spend 30 minutes. Tickets also good for 2 days. Metric shit ton of butterflies, birds, and couple turtles. 
- Hemingway House is $17/person. It's a neat house, but you're really paying $17 a head to see some fat cats.
- Southernmost Point is for Instagram. If you *gotta* go, go early. White girls sleep late.

### Beaches
- [Fort Zachary Taylor](http://www.fortzacharytaylor.com/) state park is great. During the day, even on weekends, almost nobody is on the beach. Good, quiet spot. $7 cash for 2 people to get in, and the pass gets you in all day. You can go in the morning, leave for lunch, and come back at no extra charge. While you're here, you can walk some 'hiking' paths, and tour the fort, with or without a guide.
- [Bahia Honda](https://www.floridastateparks.org/BahiaHonda) (bye-uh) is on it's own island up the keys, and worth visiting if you want a quiet beach day. Lots of good places to eat along the way, too. $9 for 2 people. When you get through the guard house, you turn left and go all the way to the end. The right side is all the campers. There's a beach there, but it's far more crowded and looks out to the old Bahia Honda bridge plus the highway.
- [Dry Tortugas NP](https://www.drytortugas.com/) is the best place to snorkel and beach! Not cheap to get to but all things considered it's not bad. $380 for 2 ferry tickets that include breakfast, lunch, unlimited water, coffee, and ginger ale, plus some snorkel gear. Takes 2.5 hours to get there, so if you get seasick, you can buy dramamine for $1/dose on the boat. Beaches and water are perfect. Watch out for buried i-beams on the north beach, though.

### Transport
Don't bother with anything unless you're *really* opposed to walking or plan on going up the keys. This tourist part of the island is barely 2 square miles. If you *must* find alternate methods, biking is a cake walk, and cheap as hell. You can get cruiser bikes for $10/day.

If you want to go up the keys though, rent a jeep from [Key West Adventures](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Key+West+Adventures+-+Jeep+Rentals+and+More/@24.5715364,-81.7635351,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b1434c05d1ab:0xf3379e81dc14d1f8!8m2!3d24.5715364!4d-81.7613464). Really accomodating staff, local family owned, solid prices. We used them to get a jeep to take up to Bahia Honda. $40 add on beach day package comes with a cooler, ice, umbrella, and 2 chairs. They'll pick you up wherever you're staying, and drop you off after. 

## Food
### Breakfast
- [La Grignote](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Grignote/@24.5493802,-81.7977813,19.49z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x88d1b134ad952377:0x3fcee92f77463b5e!2sKey+West,+FL+33040!3b1!8m2!3d24.5550593!4d-81.7799871!3m4!1s0x88d1b6dcdc2a3ab9:0x2ab7ff12e47246c2!8m2!3d24.5489966!4d-81.7974775) is a great place to eat, and they're also a pastry shop. You can go sit down or grab a pastry and go. They do lunch as well, but we didn't eat there for lunch. 
- [Moondog Cafe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Moondog+Cafe/@24.5515826,-81.8032629,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b7a1de96064d:0x426e97408b998beb!8m2!3d24.5515645!4d-81.8010934) had great food and atmosphere, but don't come here for mimosas unless you have a high credit card limit.

### Lunch/Dinner
- [Kaya Island Eats](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kaya+Island+Eats/@24.5522727,-81.8026116,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x88d1b1485b6add9f:0x889dbc23e4c7426c!2sCroissants+de+France+Bakery+%26+Restaurant!8m2!3d24.5522727!4d-81.8004229!3m4!1s0x88d1b7e0556b90a1:0x8ef8bd4652d896b4!8m2!3d24.5537609!4d-81.8015734) was probably our favorite all around place. Enter through the alley on Angela St, not the karaoke bar on Duval. Staff are awesome and friendly.
- [Courthouse Deli](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Courthouse+Deli+%26+Whit's+Frozen+Custard/@24.55395,-81.8040753,18z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x88d1b6e9a9ebb513:0x227614c9b6a4ffbd!2sThe+Courthouse+Deli+%26+Whit's+Frozen+Custard!8m2!3d24.5539806!4d-81.8032084!3m4!1s0x88d1b6e9a9ebb513:0x227614c9b6a4ffbd!8m2!3d24.5539806!4d-81.8032084) has great sandwiches, but they have some kick ass frozen custard. 
- [El Meson de Pepe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/El+Meson+De+Pepe's+Restaurant+%26+Bar/@24.5602814,-81.8061072,18z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x88d1b6e9a9ebb513:0x227614c9b6a4ffbd!2sThe+Courthouse+Deli+%26+Whit's+Frozen+Custard!8m2!3d24.5539806!4d-81.8032084!3m4!1s0x88d1b6ec85131299:0xa7917bf52a7a123e!8m2!3d24.55998!4d-81.8070334) is awesome Cuban food, and have a good tapas setup if you're looking for that.

- [B.O.'s Fish Wagon](https://www.google.com/maps/place/B.O.'s+Fish+Wagon/@24.5604667,-81.8030469,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6ea9ebe9901:0x3d3d6ed3fbd57278!8m2!3d24.5604667!4d-81.8008582) is a bit quirky, but has good friend food and fish tacos.

### Snacks
- [The Conch Shack](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Conch+Shack/@24.5595444,-81.8078748,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6eb78a03b59:0x805bae8df56a7d25!8m2!3d24.5595444!4d-81.8056861) solid conch fritters, and idk they do much else.

### Drinks
- [Tiki House](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tiki+House/@24.5584649,-81.8053416,20.17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x88d1b1784f4fcfa9:0x9e6ff11b0934c2d9!2sThe+Raw+Machine!8m2!3d24.5486219!4d-81.7973058!3m4!1s0x88d1b6eb9b2d9d83:0xc0d15049e5a8ed20!8m2!3d24.558909!4d-81.805345) for tiki drinks
- [Rum Bar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Rum+Bar/@24.5496891,-81.8002677,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88d1b6dd2f357a85:0x10d0a125752c72a6!8m2!3d24.5497071!4d-81.7980924) is mostly rum, although they have other things. Great patio setting, good to people watch.

Lot of variety, good house specials.
- [Green Parrot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Green+Parrot+Bar/@24.5559434,-81.8035398,17.87z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x88d1b6dd2f357a85:0x10d0a125752c72a6!2sThe+Rum+Bar!8m2!3d24.5497071!4d-81.7980924!3m4!1s0x88d1b6e9afa07f93:0x17f5ae333d1ea843!8m2!3d24.5540957!4d-81.8030034) is the same as above

Beer is good, and the food is pretty solid too. I consistently reordered a Crazy Lady most places we went.
